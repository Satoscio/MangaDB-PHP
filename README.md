## Manga Library Database

This is a project I made in my last year of high school, in the hopes of it being presented at my final exam.

It was written purely with the knowledge I acquired in the programming class (that's why it sucks lol), so don't expect anything too fancy.

This project uses a local SQLite database stored as `manga.db` in `/model/dbaccess/manga.db`

The queries needed to create a compatible database are found in the `create_db.sql` file.

To run/host this, you can clone the repo via CLI or download the source code .zip via GitHub and use an Apache web server (I only ever used XAMPP sorry)
